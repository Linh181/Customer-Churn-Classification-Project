# A-Classification-Project
This is a classification project on the churn dataset. First, we perform data exploration and analysis to get an initial insight about the data. Then, we handle the missing values by imputatation and perform data scaling as well as dimension reduction. After preprocessing the data, several promising models are fitted and assessed on the train dataset. The next step is to use model selection method to optimize the hyperparameters. Finally, the best models are evaluated using the test dataset.
